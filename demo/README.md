# Cardano Simple DApp

## What is this?

This is a simple app that lets you connect your Cardano wallet (like Nami, Eternl, or Flint) to see your wallet information and send ADA to other addresses. It's designed to be straightforward and easy to use, even if you're not familiar with technical details.

## What can I do with it?

With this app, you can:

1. **Connect your Cardano wallet** - Works with popular wallets like Nami, Eternl, Flint, and others
2. **View your wallet information**:
   - See your wallet address
   - Check your ADA balance
   - See how many different tokens you have
3. **Send ADA to anyone**:
   - Enter a recipient's address
   - Choose how much ADA to send
   - Complete the transaction with a few clicks

## How to use it

### Connecting your wallet

1. When you first open the app, you'll see buttons for different wallet options
2. Click the button for the wallet you use (Nami, Eternl, etc.)
3. Your wallet will ask for permission to connect - click "Allow" or "Connect"
4. Once connected, you'll see your wallet information displayed

### Viewing your wallet information

After connecting, you'll automatically see:
- Which network you're on (Mainnet or Testnet)
- Your wallet address (shortened for privacy)
- Your current ADA balance
- The number of different tokens in your wallet

### Sending ADA to someone

1. Find the "Send ADA" section
2. Enter the recipient's wallet address in the first box
3. Enter the amount of ADA you want to send
4. Click the "Send Transaction" button
5. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the transaction
6. After confirming, you'll see a success message with the transaction ID

### Disconnecting your wallet

If you want to disconnect your wallet:
1. Click the "Disconnect Wallet" button at the top
2. Your wallet information will no longer be visible
3. To reconnect, click the "Reconnect Wallet" button

## Important notes

- **Security**: This app never stores your private keys or seed phrases
- **Transactions**: When you send ADA, the transaction is processed directly by the Cardano blockchain
- **Fees**: Standard Cardano network fees apply to transactions (typically a small amount of ADA)
- **Confirmation time**: Transactions usually confirm within minutes but can sometimes take longer

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- **Wallet not connecting?** Make sure your wallet extension is installed and unlocked
- **Balance not showing?** Try reconnecting your wallet or refreshing the page
- **Transaction failing?** Check that you have enough ADA for the transaction plus fees
- **Wrong network?** Some wallets may be connected to the testnet - switch to mainnet for real transactions
